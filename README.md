# Description of tree
This is a simple applicatons that will print out a directory tree in a 
graphically manner. It is modeled after the linux tree command. On my mac tree
does not come with it so I created a simple replacement in Perl for it. However,
recently when I upgrade, the Perl verison stop working because of missing dependeces
and I thought I rewrite in Go, to give Go a go. So, far is just does the basics
but I would love to hear how I could imporve it and/or code.
